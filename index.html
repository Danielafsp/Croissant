    <p>
      A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
      It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
      Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
      <br />
      <br />
      The kipferl, an Austrian pastry crescent-shaped, can be dated back to at
      least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The kipferl
      can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the
      rugelach a form of kipfer)
